# Transport for NSW

Create a calendar using your favourite JavaScript web framework. The calendar should display information for incidents and alerts on the NSW public transport network.

You can find incident and alert data on this API: https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au/node/601/exploreapi#!/default/tfnsw_addinfo_request. Note, you will need to sign up for an account to access this API. Once you sign up, you can create an Application under “My Account” and assign the Trip Planning APIs to your new Application.

Please feel free to implement any filters, search functionality or UI design, etc that you think will help the customer navigate this data. One basic example of how this might look is included below. Transport for NSW caters for a wide range of users across the state, so your solution should work on different sized screens and should be screen reader and keyboard accessible.

The application should be written to be production ready. Please use the opportunity to demonstrate how you create high quality web applications. Use all the techniques and patterns you would normally use for a production application. To submit your solution, please commit your code to a public git repository (such as GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket) and provide us access details. You should include documentation of your solution including instructions for how to run your application.

If you have any questions, please reach out to Aaron.Thomson@transport.nsw.gov.au.
